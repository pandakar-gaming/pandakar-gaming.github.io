# Final Fantasy IV

This game made me look at damage numbers because the amount of damage Zeromus was outputting was ridiculous. This is in comparison to the rest of the game, which was already quite frankly putting out ridiculous damage.

As part of this look, I made a very limited damage calculator focused specifically on Zeromus's damage: [meteor_planner.py](meteor_planner.py). This was to help see whether I needed to grind more levels, if gear would solve the issue or if I could play better.
