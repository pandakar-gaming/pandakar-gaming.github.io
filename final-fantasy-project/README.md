# Final Fantasy Project

This is a long-term goal to beat every mainline Final Fantasy!

Some of these I have played, some I have not. My aim is to beat every mainline game in order. 

This is a stream-centric project - all of these playthroughs will be streamed live at [twitch.tv/pandakar](https://www.twitch.tv/pandakar). I'll aim to also upload my playthroughs on YouTube for easier VOD access. 

## But Why?

Every time a new Final Fantasy comes out, the internet cries out and says "man this game ain't a real Final Fantasy this is trash." With FFXVI coming out recently and the same discourse happening, that got me thinking - what *makes* a Final Fantasy game? It's clearly not the plot, so what elements are common between games in this long spanning franchise?

Along with that, I've been playing Final Fantasy games for years. Started with FFIX one week when I was sick in high school and never stopped after that. I've played various games throughout the franchise but not all of them. 

## Where are the MMOs?

There's a few reasons I am avoiding MMOs:

- I already play FFXIV on a regular basis
- I have no knowledge of FFXI nor how involved it is to actually go through its "main" story
- These would take way too long

## Schedule

We'll be kicking this off at the beginning of October! Specifically starting Wednesday, October 4 @ 6:00PM PDT.

Currently planned times:

- Wednesday, starting at 6:00PM PDT for 4h
- Saturday, starting at 4:00PM PDT for 6h

This will be taking a while. In the beginning I'll be budgeting two days a week (Wednesday and Saturday). In the new year I hope to add in more days so we can crunch through some of the longer games. The hope here is to wrap up **all** of the mainline games before the next FFXIV expansion, which is slated for Summer 2024.

See time estimates below for each game.

* some of these games I may actually be able to play on original hardware. Requires testing, but possibility exists.

Some of these games may inspire me to look deeper into their mechanics and/or make tools that will help me get through the game without having to spend time grinding monsters. Any such tools will be listed in [Miscellaneous Tools](/misc_tools).
